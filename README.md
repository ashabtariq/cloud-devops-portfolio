# 🌩 Cloud & DevOps Consulting Portfolio

Welcome! I help businesses **design, automate, and optimize cloud infrastructure** using **AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, and CI/CD** best practices.  

This portfolio showcases practical projects that demonstrate my ability to deliver **secure, scalable, and cost-efficient solutions**.

---

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. Scalable Web Application on AWS (Terraform)
- Automated 3-tier architecture (VPC, ALB, Auto Scaling, RDS, S3, CloudFront).
- Full Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.
- Cost-optimized setup with lifecycle policies & spot instances.


### 2. CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions + ECS
- Automated container build, test, and deploy pipeline.
- Integrated AWS ECR, ECS Fargate, and rollback mechanisms.


### 3. Serverless App with AWS Lambda + API Gateway
- Built a serverless URL shortener with Lambda, DynamoDB, and Terraform.
- API secured with IAM roles and integrated logging.

### 4. Image Processing Pipeline
- User uploads to **S3 → Event triggers Lambda → Process (resize/convert) → Store in another S3 bucket**
- Terraform to provision everything.

### 5. Incident Response Automation on AWS
- Use **CloudWatch Alarms + EventBridge + Lambda** to detect anomalies (e.g., unusual IAM API calls).
- Auto-trigger a Lambda to quarantine the resource (detach IAM keys, isolate EC2 instance).

### 5. Container Security Pipelines
- Take a containerized app (Node/Python/Go).
- Add **Trivy/Grype** scans in GitHub Actions before pushing to ECR.
- Enforce **ECS task roles** and **least privilege IAM policies**.
