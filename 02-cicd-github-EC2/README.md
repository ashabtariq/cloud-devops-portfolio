# 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions + AWS ECS (Fargate)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement a **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** for a containerized web application (Node.js + React).  
The pipeline automates the full lifecycle from **Build → Test → Deploy** into **AWS ECS Fargate**, ensuring **zero-downtime deployments** and **rollback support**.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Workflow

**Key Stages:**
1. **Source Control:** Code is pushed to GitHub.
2. **Build & Test:** GitHub Actions compiles, runs tests, and builds a Docker image.
3. **Image Registry:** The container image is pushed to **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**.
4. **Deploy:** ECS Fargate service pulls the new image and updates tasks with rolling deployment.
5. **Secrets Management:** **AWS Secrets Manager** stores DB/API credentials for secure access.
6. **Monitoring & Rollbacks:** ECS service ensures rollback in case of deployment failure.

## ⚙️ Features

- **End-to-End CI/CD:** Fully automated pipeline triggered on every push to `main`.
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments:** ECS rolling updates with multiple tasks running in parallel.
- **Rollback Mechanism:** Automatic rollback to the last stable revision if deployment fails.
- **Secure Secrets Management:** Uses **AWS Secrets Manager** for credentials and environment variables.
- **Scalable & Serverless:** Runs on **ECS Fargate** (no EC2 management required).
